# Coding standards

## Formatting

The code is formatted using [Air](https://github.com/posit-dev/air) with the extra styling: please ensure that you add a line break after each parenthesis.

Make sure to run the formatter before committing any changes.

## Naming conventions

Please follow these naming conventions to maintain consistency across the codebase:

- Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
- Use `CamelCase` for class names.
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Use `lowercase` for package names.
- Use `lowercase` for file & directory names.

Variable names should be nouns, and be descriptive and concise, avoiding abbreviations unless they are widely recognized.

Also, function names should be verbs that describe the action they perform, while class names should be nouns that represent the entity they model.
