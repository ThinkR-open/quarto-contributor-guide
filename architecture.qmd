# Architecture

## Overview

The architecture of our project is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy integration of new features and components. The system is built on a microservices architecture, which enables independent development and deployment of services.

## Components

The main components of the architecture include:

- **Frontend**: The user interface built with React, providing a responsive and interactive experience.
- **Backend**: The server-side logic implemented in Node.js, handling API requests and business logic.
- **Database**: A PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

Here is a schematic representation of the architecture:
