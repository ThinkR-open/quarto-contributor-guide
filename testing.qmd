# Testing

Testing is a crucial part of the development process, ensuring that your contributions work as intended and do not introduce new issues. This section provides an overview of how to test your contributions effectively.

## Run the test suite

To run the test suite for the XYZ project, follow these steps:

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the project directory.

2. **Run the test command** using the following command:

   ```bash
   Rscript -e "devtools::test()"
   ```

This command will execute all the tests defined in the project and provide you with a summary of the results.

## Writing Tests

When writing tests for your contributions, follow these guidelines:

- **Use the `testthat` package**: This package provides a framework for writing unit tests in R. Ensure you have it installed by running:

  ```r
  install.packages("testthat")
  ```

- **Organize tests**: add a new test using `usethis::use_test("test_name")`. This will create a new test file in the `tests/testthat/` directory.

- **Write clear and concise tests**: Each test should focus on a specific functionality or behavior. Use descriptive names for your test functions to make it clear what they are testing.

- **Use assertions**: Use `testthat` assertions (e.g., `expect_equal()`, `expect_true()`, `expect_error()`) to verify that your code behaves as expected.

- **Run tests frequently**: Run your tests regularly during development to catch issues early. This will help you identify and fix problems before they become more complex.

## Running the check

To run the R package check, use the following command:

```bash
Rscript -e "devtools::check()"
```

This command will perform a series of checks on your package, including running tests, checking for code style issues, and verifying package documentation.

Please ensure that all tests pass and that there are no errors or warnings before submitting your contribution. The check will provide detailed output, including any issues that need to be addressed.

## Continuous Integration

The XYZ project uses continuous integration (CI) to automatically run tests whenever changes are made. This ensures that contributions do not break existing functionality. The CI configuration is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.

When you submit a pull request, the CI system will automatically run the test suite and provide feedback on the results. If any tests fail, you will need to address those issues before your contribution can be merged.
