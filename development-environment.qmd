# How to set your development environment

To set up your development environment for the XYZ project, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **R**: Version 4.0.0 or higher. You can download it from [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/).
- **Git**: Version control system to manage your code. Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- **PostgreSQL**: Database management system. Install it from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

## Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the XYZ project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/xyz-project.git
   cd xyz-project
   ```

2. **Install R Packages**: Open R and run the following commands to install the required R packages:

   ```r
   remotes::install_local()
   ```

3. **Set Up the Database**: Create a PostgreSQL database for the project. You can do this using the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
    psql -U postgres
    CREATE DATABASE xyz_project;
    ```

4. **Configure Database Connection**: Create a configuration file in the project directory (e.g., `config.yml`) with the following content:

    ```yaml
    database:
      host: localhost
      port: 5432
      dbname: xyz_project
      user: your_username
      password: your_password
    ```

5. **Run Database Migrations**: If the project uses migrations, run the following command to set up the database schema:

   ```bash
   Rscript -e "library(dbx); dbx::migrate()"
   ```
6. **Start the Application**: You can now start the application by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   Rscript -e "library(xyz); xyz::start_app()"
    ```

7. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the XYZ application.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the setup process, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Ensure that all prerequisites are installed correctly.
- Check the database connection settings in your configuration file.
- Review the project's documentation for any specific setup instructions.
